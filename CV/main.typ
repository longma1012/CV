- *Tech Stacks: Python, openCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow*
- Constructed a 99% accurate character recognition system, specializing in reading handwritten Chinese characters on insurance policies. This system automated the formerly manual data entry process, reducing input time significantly and increasing data accuracy.
- Devised and implemented a data transmission interface for a high-precision camera, according to its official documentation. This development allowed for seamless integration of real-time camera input into our character recognition system.
- Reviewed relevant literature and replicated #link("https://github.com/pavlo-melnyk/offline-HCCR")[Melnyk-Net] and #link("https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385")[Res-Net] models for character reading. Through fine-tuning the models' hyperparameters, successfully increased the precision by approximately 20% on the company-specific datasets.
- Designed and developed a proprietary Optical Character Recognition algorithm to address the problem of neural networks only recognizing one character at a time, effectively segmenting images with multiple characters into individual images, each containing a single character.

*Answer Alchemist* | React.js, Amazon RDS, Python #h(1fr) 2023/02 -- 2023/05 \
- Developed an intelligent Q&A platform that allows users to search for interesting Q&A entries via keywords, addressing the outdated sorting mechanisms and labor-intensive manual filtering in traditional search engines and Q&A platforms.
- Utilized *React.js* for the development of the front-end interface, including the implementation of a feature that filters Q&A based on their tags. Employed *AWS RDS* for real-time data retrieval and storage of Q&A data and used *Python* for the development of the main sorting algorithm, BM25.
- Integrated the open-source API of ChatGPT to summarize search results, further enhancing user experience.

*Parallel ConvNet* | C, CUDA #h(1fr) 2021/09 -- 2021/12 \
- Developed a DCNN utilizing parallel programming to recognize handwritten letters on white paper, enhancing the speed and accuracy of letter recognition.

*Room Reservation System* | HTML5+CSS3+JavaScript, Python Flask, MySQL, GCP #h(1fr) 2021/09 -- 2021/12 \
- In response to the outdated and inconvenient room booking system at the ZJU campus, developed a new room reservation system. Users can log into the system using their university-related credentials and make reservations for available rooms, significantly enhancing the efficiency and ease of the booking process.
- Utilized *Python Flask* to set up the entire project framework, employed *Google Cloud Platform* for data storage, and maintained the database using *MySQL* queries in *MySQL Workbench*
- Leveraged front-end languages to develop and render the web page interface.

*A Linux-like OS* | C/C++, x86 #h(1fr) 2021/02 -- 2021/05 \
- Collaborated with a team to develop a computer operating system, handling tasks such as initializing the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), virtualizing the Real-Time Clock (RTC), and managing keyboard access and System Call operations. Additionally, I introduced TAB-key command auto-completion and up&down-arrows-key command switching features to enhance system functionality.
